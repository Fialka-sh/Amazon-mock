This app has the following functionalities:

1. The user can Register to the store.

6. The user can remove selected products from the cart.

The purpose of this application was to learn and practice new Technologies,
such as:

1. Firebase - Register, login, database and deployment platform.
2. Styled components - Visual primitives for the component age.
3. Redux- A Predictable State Container for JS Apps.
4. Typescript - JavaScript with syntax for types.
5. React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

In the future app can get the following improvements:

1. Infinite loading of products.
2. Search capabilities.
3. Complete (mock) checkout process.

ENJOY.
